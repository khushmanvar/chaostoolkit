# ChaosToolkit

ChaosToolkit is a robust toolkit designed for implementing and managing chaos engineering experiments in a controlled and automated way. 
The project provides a set of tools and modules that allow developers and engineers to simulate failures and stress scenarios on their systems, 
helping to identify weak points and improve resilience.

## Features

- **Simulate Failures**: Introduce a variety of failure types (e.g., network latency, CPU spikes, memory leaks) to test system stability.
- **Automated Scenarios**: Create automated chaos scenarios with predefined conditions and cleanup procedures.
- **Customizable Experiments**: Define experiment parameters and customize chaos testing to suit your environment.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports of each experiment, highlighting areas of success and failure.

## Installation

To install ChaosToolkit, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khushmanvar/chaostoolkit.git
cd chaostoolkit
make install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies.

## Usage

ChaosToolkit can be used via the command line to run predefined chaos scenarios. Here is a basic command structure:

```bash
chaostoolkit run <scenario-file>
```

For a complete list of commands and options, use:

```bash
chaostoolkit --help
```

## Examples

To run an example scenario, navigate to the `examples` directory and execute:

```bash
chaostoolkit run examples/network_latency.yaml
```

This example simulates network latency issues to observe how the system behaves under delayed network conditions.
